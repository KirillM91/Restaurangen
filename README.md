### A school project at Medieinstitutet made by Fanny Lundberg and Kirill Missarov.
### The goal was to create a booking system for a fictional restaurant.
### The admin page is visible to the user, for the sake of this project. And not something that should be accessible by the user in a real project. 
### The project was done in 3 weeks.
